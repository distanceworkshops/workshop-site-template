# Template for workshop sites

If you want a site for your workshop, click "Use this tempalte" above, ensure that `distanceexamples` is the "Owner" in the following page. Clone that repo on your computer and start editing. The `index.md` page is read to edit, search and replace the strings "`YOUR-WORKSHOP`" and "`YOUR-WORKSHOP-REPO-NAME`" and fill-in-the-blanks.


## When you're ready for the site to go live

Note that you'll need to setup the repo to use [GitHub Pages](https://guides.github.com/features/pages/). Currently that consists of the following steps:

- Click settings on the repo page (*make sure it's your new repo not this one*)
- Scroll to "GitHub Pages"
- Set the source branch to "master"
- Click "Save"

Note your site will be rendered at `workshops.distancesampling.org/YOUR-REPO-NAME`, so make sure you choose a reasonable repository name.

## Looking at things locally first

This can be a pain, as it requires a local install of `ruby`. See [this github howto](https://docs.github.com/en/github/working-with-github-pages/testing-your-github-pages-site-locally-with-jekyll) if you want to try this.
