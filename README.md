# Template for workshop sites

If you want a site for your workshop, click "Use this tempalte" above. Clone that repo on your computer and start editing.

Note that you'll need to setup the repo to use [GitHub Pages](https://guides.github.com/features/pages/). Currently that consists of the following steps:

- Click settings on the repo page (*make sure it's your new repo not this one*)
- Scroll to "GitHub Pages"
- Set the source branch to "master"

Note your site will be rendered at `workshops.distancesampling.org/YOUR-REPO-NAME`, so make sure you choose a reasonable repository name.
